# Food Me Please
A restaurant recommendation application.

Built using HTML, CSS, Express, and Node.js

How to Setup
Run 'npm install' to install the required dependencies for our project.
Run 'npm run' to start the server.
Go to localhost:3000 to load the website.

How the Application Works
Upon loading the website, the first page will be the landing page. Here you will be able to make a specific query if you already have a restaurant in mind, otherwise you may click on the Quiz link to redirect you to the quiz. In the quiz you can choose what sort of cuisine you are in the mood for, what price point(s) you would like, how far from your location you want to go, among more. Upon submitting each form, you will be redirected to a results page that will list the restaurants from the query and upon clicking a specific query, it will send you to a restaurant details page, which include more details about the restaurant.

API Keys
This web application integrates the Yelp Fusion API. In order to run the application properly, request API keys from Yelp Fusion and then insert that key into the api.js.
